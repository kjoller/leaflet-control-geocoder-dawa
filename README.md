leaflet-control-geocoder-dawa
=============================

This is mostly here for historical reasons. It will not work with the latest version of Per Liedmans geocoder. I have created a fork of that geocoder and included DAWA-functionality here:

https://github.com/kjoller/leaflet-control-geocoder

A Danish Address Web API (DAWA) geocoder object for leaflet-control-geocoder by Per Liedman.

Leaflet Control Geocoder is a small plugin for leaflet for geocoding (finding adresses) in leaflet, and now it works with DAWA too.

Coded by Niels Kj√∏ller Hansen, under the employ of the City of Frederiksberg.
