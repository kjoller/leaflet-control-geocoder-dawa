## Leaflet geocoder with DAWA support
Hi all. This is a plugin for Per Liedmann's Leaflet.Control.Geocoder, using the Danish Address Web API (DAWA). 

### Demo
I have made a demo, where the API is limited to geocoding addresses in the City of Frederiksberg (municipal code 0147):

### Just the files, please
If you need the files, and cannot be bothered to build them from source, they can be picked up here:

http://lab.kjlr.dk/static/leaflet-control-geocoder-dawa.zip (this URL will probably change, so please check back if you need the zip-file again).
